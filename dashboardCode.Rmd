## Introduction {.sidebar}
This dashboard is being constructed for DACSS 690V: Data Visualization, a course taught by Dr. Jose Manuel Magallanes Reyes in the Winter 2024 session at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. As of January 2, 2025, this dashboard contains one plot: a boxplot of student-teacher ratios at K-12 schools in Washington, which refers to @heckmann_ratio_2024 for additional context.
